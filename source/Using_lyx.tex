\chapter{Using The \LyX{} Layouts}

There are two layout files for \LyX{}, one for chapters, one for the
master document. To use a layout, go to \textsf{Layout\lyxarrow{}Document}
and choose \noun{beavtex,} either \noun{master}, for the main
document or \noun{chapter} for individual chapters. 

I chose this design because I thought people would benefit from having
a separation between all of the information necessary for the pretext
pages, and the information necessary for the chapters. The information
on the pretext pages can then be forgotten, as you work on files that
are specific to either the rest of your thesis (all chapters can be
included in one file) or to a particular chapter (each chapter/section
can have its own file).

In \LyX{}, you can include individual chapter by using \textsf{Insert\lyxarrow{}Include
File.} Make sure that you check include (as opposed to input, unless
you desire this \LaTeX{} option) in the dropdown menu of the popup
window.
