\abstract{\beavtex is a replacement for the old osuthesis class. It is both
a \LaTeX{} class and set of \LyX{} layout files that allow the user
to quickly and painlessly format a thesis according to the requirements
of the Oregon State University Graduate School. Most, if not all,
formatting requirements are automagically prepared. It was created
from the ground up, with some input from a historical set of files
and macros, both from OSU and external sources. This fake thesis serves
both as an example and as documentation. It contains full documentation
on all of \beavtexnospace 's options, as well as on the \LyX{} layout
files.}


\acknowledgements{This page is mostly here to demonstrate one of the pretext pages.
However, there \emph{are} a lot of people who deserve some credit
for making the earlier incarnations of the osuthesis class possible.
Unfortunately, I don't even know who they all are. I've gathered what
names I could that were sprinkled around various source files to the
original osuthesis class. One of the template files that I found acknowledges
Dr. Gregg Rothermel of the Oregon State University Software Engineering
Group, but states that {}``most of the credit for the real work in
creating {[}one of the original versions{]}, however, belongs to Lixin
Li and Chengyun Chu.'' That file also states that it was modified
by Alexey G. Malishevsky. I got these templates from Eric Altendorf,
who in turn got them from Rogan Creswick, whence he got them, I don't
know. Both Eric and Rogan apparently did a lot of work on what were
a large number of templates and macros. Both of those intrepid explorers
weeded through code a great deal to leave something better and easier
for the next users. Some of the macros from those original templates
are included here and have helped build this class--- especially the
table of contents formatting, which is the main section culled from
those original templates. Some credit should also also go to Norman
Gall of University of Calgary, who wrote a .cls file for Rayees Shamsuddin,
who in turn sent it to me. I didn't actually use any of Norman's code
(at least, I don't think I did), but the fact that he went through
the trouble to create a \LaTeX{} class for others to use is deserving
of credit.}
